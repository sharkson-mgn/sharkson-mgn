# Hello World.
- 👋 Hi, I’m @maganiczny
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and general IT, software and hardware.
- 🌱 Every day I try to learn something new. For over 10 years, more or less amateur, I create code in programming languages ​​such as PHP and JavaScript. In addition to these languages, I have had contact with other technologies, including: Windows batch files (bat), Unix shell scripts (sh), Python, C ++, Java, Assembler and others. I created very simple applications for Android. When programming in PHP, I had to often demonstrate my knowledge of HTML and CSS, it happened that I used jQuery and Bootstrap libraries more than once. Fullstack is not only programming languages, it is also knowledge in the field of software application and operation. In the unix system I feel very well, on a daily basis I work with a server to which I connect, among others using SSH (knowledge of the terminal), which is based on the Linux system, inside such services as HTTP, SQL, NodeJs, Redis, all separated thanks to containerization of services (Docker [-Compose]). I published my first page at the age of 17 (12 years ago!), I wrote it in PHP (a site with game codes, it was wanted at the time). Today I am taking steps in NodeJS, practicing creating web applications, one of them is my blog. I know libraries like React (Redux), Express and others.
<!-- 🌱 Every day I try to learn something new. I know PHP (oop), JS (with jQuery, basics of nodejs and react), so HTML and CSS too. I'am maintly full stack (web)dev but I know how works c++, Assembler, Bash/Shell, Perl, Java, Delphi and others languages. Show me language or library, give me a minute and I build something in this space. Besides, it administers its own server => this is knowledge about docker (compose), many distribution of linux and their difference structures, this is knowledge about services and administrative of server system. I have been dealing with this for over 5 years.-->
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all who need worker's and not only. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...? Can You find me on Jabber: mgn@jix.im and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-%C5%82uczak-694974228/)
- 👍 I’m currently learning React.js + Redux.

You see, also I like word games, some sentences perfectly describe and hitly summing certain situations or mainly the world.
