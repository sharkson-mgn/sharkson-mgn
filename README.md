Programming is my passion. Every day i trying to learn something new. I tried my strong on many areas.

Generally I proggramed in PHP and JavaScript. I have well skills in HTML and CSS. It not is all - i had contact with all from basic languages like shell programing, ae bat or sh, through Pascal (including Object Pascal), a little bit of Java, C++, maybe also Lua scripting or Python. I have projects, big and small in many areas. I created projects in Laravel and React. Currently I gain knowledge in Symfony and Vue.

Not only programing. Also sysops. I am a administrator of small webserver. It makes no difference to me. Fedora or Debian. Host system or dockerized.

You see, also I like word games, some sentences perfectly describe and hitly summing certain situations or mainly the world.
