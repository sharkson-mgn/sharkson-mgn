# Hello World.

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sharkson

Programming is my passion. Every day i trying to learn something new. I tried my strong on many areas.

I am a fullstack developer specializing in frontend. It not is all - i had contact with all from basic languages like shell programing, ae bat or sh, through Pascal (including Object Pascal), a little bit of Java, C++, maybe also Lua scripting or Python. I have projects, big and small in many areas. I created projects in Laravel and React. Currently I gain knowledge in Symfony and Vue.

Not only programing. Also sysops/sysadmin. It makes no difference to me. Fedora or Debian. Host system or dockerized.

You see, also I like word games, some sentences perfectly describe and hitly summing certain situations or mainly the world.
